Demand forcasting
Forecasting models for scooter demand can employ various approaches, such as time series models or simple regression when a linear relationship between variables exists. When historical data is available and the distribution of previous data is known, Bayesian models offer a robust method for estimating future demand. This assumes no major changes in data distribution due to factors like new policies promoting scooter usage, which could significantly increase user numbers. Ensemble techniques, including XGB, LGBM, and CatBoost, can be used to predict potential users based on factors like date, season, year, month, hour, holiday, weekday, working day, weather, temperature, perceived temperature, humidity, wind speed, and existing users. In Table 7, we summarized some the methods that have been used for bike and scooter demand prediction. ![image](https://github.com/Slmaking/Bike-sharing/assets/58626257/9436df0e-a61e-4e56-9ff3-c51d125a7c7d)
